Hi there,

Every year, hundreds of thousands of developers like yourself take on the challenge and join Hacktoberfest. This is a time to contribute to open source, improve your skills, and build greater technology in the process. Thanks to your dedication in 2019, 483,127 pull requests were opened, and 61,871 people completed the challenge.

From your first to your fiftieth (and beyond) pull request, we’re here to support your learning journey. That’s why we’ve created Preptember, where we focus on providing resources, tools, and love  to our Hacktoberfest community. All of September is dedicated to learning and sharing knowledge in preparation for October.
